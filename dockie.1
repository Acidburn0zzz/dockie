.SH NAME
.PP
Dockie - manage unprivileged chroot environments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dockie [-dhv] {exec | image | ls | import | pull | rm | run | search}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Dockie is a wrapper around PRoot to manage unprivileged chroots with a
familiar interface.
.PP
PRoot, and therefore Dockie, are not security features and should not be
used as such.
PRoot should only be used as a \[lq]soft sandbox\[rq] where you can:
.IP \[bu] 2
test some other distros features,
.IP \[bu] 2
fake root privileges or
.IP \[bu] 2
build packages from source without polluting your environment
.PP
knowing that whatever gets into your PRoot will be able to get out into
your host OS.
.SS Pulling
.PP
Dockie is able to pull packages from either the LXC image server or from
the Docker Hub.
LXC support is native to Dockie and Docker Hub\[cq]s is done through a
contrib script included with the Dockie releases.
.PP
Dockie stores its data inside DOCKER_PATH, if the environment variable
is set, otherwise inside HOME/.local/var/lib/dockie.
.PP
To pull images the image and version need to be speicifed from the
command line in the form of image:version.
Images that have been either pulled from a remote repository are stored
inside the images directory as a tarball together with a file containing
its formatted metadata.
.PP
As the repositories are provided by third-parties there is no built-in
search mechanism.
The search comnmand will output the URL of the repository where the user
can browse the available images.
.SS Importing
.PP
Dockie also allows importing local images as tarballs.
These tarballs need to only contain the root file system as Dockie will
take care of the metadata.
The name of the file will be used as the name of the image so it is
recommended not to use files such as rootfs.tar.
.SS Running
.PP
To use these images the run subcommand is used.
Run will always create a new guest and assign it a unique ID.
It extracts the selected image if it is available locally, otherwise it
pulls it from the configured remote repository.
If a command is specified it also runs the command.
This environment is called a guest.
.PP
Guests are inside the guests directory and include the rootfs directory
as well as a formatted metadata file.
.SS Executing
.PP
For guests that have already been creating, the exec subcommand will
execute a command inside the guest, usually /bin/sh or /bin/bash, but
any command can be used.
